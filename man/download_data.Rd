\title{Load base-rate database, model typicality matrices, or human validation ratings}
\usage{
download_data(
  which = c("database", "validation_ratings", "typicality_matrix_gpt4",
    "typicality_matrix_llama3.3"),
  dest = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{which}{One of "database", "validation_ratings", "typicality_matrix_gpt4", or "typicality_matrix_llama3.3".}

\item{dest}{Optional path to copy the file to (returns the data either way).}
}
\value{
A tibble with the requested data.
}
\description{
This function gives access to key datasets included in the \code{baserater} package.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The \code{"database"} object includes all base-rate items along with stereotype strength estimates from GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.3.
\item The \code{"validation_ratings"} object contains average typicality judgments from 50 human participants on 100 groupâ€“adjective pairs, as well as ratings from GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.3.
\item The \code{"typicality_matrix_gpt4"} and \code{"typicality_matrix_llama3.3"} objects are raw typicality matrices generated by each model.
}
}
\examples{
# Load the full base-rate database (LLM-generated stereotype strengths)
database <- download_data("database")

# Load validation ratings (human, GPT-4, LLaMA 3.3) for 100 items
ratings <- download_data("validation_ratings")

# Load the raw typicality matrix from GPT-4
gpt4_matrix <- download_data("typicality_matrix_gpt4")

# Load the raw typicality matrix from LLaMA 3.3
llama3_matrix <- download_data("typicality_matrix_llama3.3")
